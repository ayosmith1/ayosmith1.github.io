I think something that was hard was deciding which lattice points to put each vertex on. Even though technically it doesnt matter that much as long as the form has the shape I desire, 
  I was having trouble with it, especially during the sketch. I also dont know if not having (300,300) as the middle helped me or not. 

I am proud of the fact that I did not need as much help from my peers to complete the assignment as I used to. That signifes that I am making progress in my ability.

I think something that made more sense was just the basics of how to add in vertecies.
